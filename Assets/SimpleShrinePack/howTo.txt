How to use Object Prefabs

1: You can add the prefabs to your scene by dragging and dropping them to where you want them to be
2: You can adjust their colors by dragging one of the materials in the materials folder onto the object in the scene
3: If you want to change the material for a whole prefab, go into the prefab and change the material there
4: For better stonepaths you can adjust the position of single rocks of the PathStone prefabs by double clicking them

How to Setup the "SeasonChanger":

The "SeasonChanger" works by changing the color of 3 linked materials. These can be found in the materials folder and are identifiable by their naming.
You can change the different season colors inside of the "SeasonChanger" prefab. The "Season Counter" variable cycles from 1 to 4, 1 being spring and 4 being Winter.
The duration of the color change is also changeable through the "Duration" variable. There are "smartTree" and normal tree prefabs, the "smartTrees" come with
the smart (color changing) Materials attached, the normal trees have different materials attached depending on their season.

1: Drag the "SeasonChanger" prefab from Assets > SimpleShrinePack > Prefabs into your Scene
2: Use the "SmartTree" Prefabs or apply the Smart Materials to the Objects you want to have change color during season changes
3: Adjust the colors to your liking in the "SeasonChanger" Prefab
4: Seasons can be changed by calling the function "changeSeason()" or changing the number of the "SeasonCounter" variable
   (Demo Scene uses a button that calls "changeSeason()" in the "SeasonChanger" prefab)
